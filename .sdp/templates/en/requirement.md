# <Requirement Title>

## Background & Purpose
<Describe why this requirement is needed and what problem it solves>

Example:
Currently, requirements definition is time-consuming, and misalignments with the development team occur frequently. By managing requirements in a structured format, we want to improve overall team productivity.

## User Stories
<Describe user requests from a user's perspective in the format of "Who", "What", "Why">

Example:
- As a project manager, I want to input requirements in natural language so that I can quickly define requirements without memorizing formats.
- As a developer, I want specifications with clear acceptance criteria so that I don't have to wonder what to implement.
- As a team leader, I want to easily integrate requirements with issue management tools so that I can centrally manage progress.

## Functional Requirements
<Describe "what the system should do" from a business perspective. Do not mention technical implementation methods>

### Requirement 1: <Feature Name>
<Describe what should be able to be done>

Example:
**Requirements Input and Structuring**
Convert requirements described in natural language into a structured format that is easy for the entire team to understand.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Can input natural language text
- [ ] Requirement specifications are generated from the input content
- [ ] Generated specifications include background/purpose, user stories, functional requirements, and constraints
- [ ] An automatically assigned name is given to identify the same requirement

### Requirement 2: <Feature Name>
<Describe what should be able to be done>

Example:
**Updating Existing Requirements**
Review and update the content of requirements that have been created once.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Can select and update existing requirements
- [ ] Manually added content is preserved
- [ ] When it was updated is recorded

## Constraints
<Business constraints and rules. Business requirements constraints, not technical constraints>

Example:
- Processing time: Maximum 30 seconds that users can wait
- Target language: Japanese only (considering English in the future)
- Access restrictions: Only project members can view and edit
- Data retention: Requirements are permanently stored until deleted

## Notes & Remarks
<Other business requirements or expectations to consider during implementation>

Example:
- Maintain consistency with existing requirements management processes
- Gradual release with feedback and continuous improvement
- In the future, we want to make templates customizable

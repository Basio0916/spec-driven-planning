# Task Breakdown Schema
# This file defines the structure of .sdp/<slug>/tasks.yml files

# Requirement identifier slug (e.g., "add-user-authentication")
requirement: string

# Array of tasks for this requirement
tasks:
  - id: string              # Task identifier (T-001, T-002, ...)
    title: string           # Short, descriptive task title
    description: string     # 1-3 line explanation of the work

    # Files or artifacts to be created/modified
    deliverables: [string]  # e.g., ["backend/internal/auth/handler.go", "frontend/pages/login.vue"]

    # Definition of Done (testable completion criteria)
    dod: [string]           # e.g., ["Unit tests pass", "Integration tests added", "Code reviewed"]

    # Task dependencies (tasks that must complete before this one can start)
    depends_on: [string]    # e.g., ["T-001", "T-003"]

    # PERT estimate
    estimate:
      method: pert          # Always "pert" (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)
      optimistic: number    # Optimistic estimate (minimum expected time)
      most_likely: number   # Most likely time (realistic estimate)
      pessimistic: number   # Pessimistic estimate (maximum expected time)
      unit: h               # Always "h" (hours)

    # Optional risk notes for this task
    risks: string           # e.g., "External API may be unstable, requiring error handling"

# Critical Path: Array of task IDs representing the longest dependency chain
# This determines the minimum project duration
critical_path: [string]     # e.g., ["T-001", "T-003", "T-007", "T-010"]

# Rollup: Project-level metrics calculated from all tasks
rollup:
  # Sum of PERT expected values: (optimistic + 4*most_likely + pessimistic) / 6
  expected_hours: number

  # Propagated standard deviation: sqrt(sum of variances)
  # Variance per task = ((pessimistic - optimistic) / 6)^2
  stddev_hours: number

  # Confidence level: low | med | high
  confidence: string

  # Brief explanation of confidence level
  rationale: string         # e.g., "High: Requirements well understood, experienced team, minimal external dependencies"

# Example:
# requirement: "add-user-authentication"
# tasks:
#   - id: "T-001"
#     title: "Setup project structure"
#     description: "Create initial directory structure and configuration files for the authentication module."
#     deliverables:
#       - "backend/internal/auth/handler.go"
#       - "backend/internal/auth/service.go"
#       - "backend/internal/auth/repository.go"
#     dod:
#       - "Directory structure created according to project layout"
#       - "Basic handler/service/repository interfaces defined"
#       - "Unit test files created with placeholder tests"
#     depends_on: []
#     estimate:
#       method: pert
#       optimistic: 2
#       most_likely: 3
#       pessimistic: 5
#       unit: h
#     risks: "None - straightforward setup task"
#
# critical_path: ["T-001", "T-003", "T-005"]
# rollup:
#   expected_hours: 45.5
#   stddev_hours: 6.2
#   confidence: "high"
#   rationale: "All tasks are well-defined with clear deliverables and experienced team members assigned"

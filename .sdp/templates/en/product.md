- In the〇〇industry, it provides ×× experience through △△

## Target Users / JTBD (Jobs To Be Done)
<Describe "who", "in what situation", and "what they want to do" for each user type>

Example:
- **Developers** want to quickly create structured specifications when defining requirements for new features
- **Project Managers** want to understand accurate effort and risks when estimating tasks
- **Team Leaders** want to visualize the critical path and bottlenecks when managing progress

## Core Value / KPIs

<Key metrics to measure product success. Set specific definitions and target values>

| KPI | Definition | Target | Notes |
|-----|------------|--------|-------|
| Requirement Definition Time | Time to complete definition per requirement | Within 30 minutes | 50% reduction from conventional |
| Estimation Accuracy | Deviation rate between actual and estimated effort | Within ±20% | Using PERT method |
| Task Completion Rate | Percentage of tasks completed as planned | 85% or higher | During MVP period |

## Top User Stories (MVP)

<High-priority user stories to be realized in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)>

Example:
- As a **Developer**, I want to **convert natural language requirements into structured specifications** so that **I can prevent omissions and gaps in requirements**
- As a **Project Manager**, I want to **automatically generate accurate effort estimates using the PERT method** so that **I can improve the accuracy of schedule planning**
- As a **Team Leader**, I want to **bulk export tasks to GitHub Issues** so that **I can streamline project management**

## Out of Scope (MVP)

<Features and scope explicitly excluded from MVP. Include hints for future versions>

Example:
- Real-time collaboration features (to be considered in future versions)
- Multi-language support (Japanese only)
- Custom report generation (fixed templates)
- Integration with external project management tools (other than GitHub)
- AI-powered automatic requirement generation (to be introduced gradually)

## Business Constraints

<Business constraints. License, cost, deadline, resources, etc.>

Example:
- **Budget**: Development within $50K
- **Deadline**: MVP release within 3 months
